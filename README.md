### How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Optimizations

I decided to stray away from the typical casino slot machine and incorporate tarot cards as my reel options (which was a fun little CSS task for me.)

### Lessons Learned:
Another very early-on project me when it comes to JavaScript specifically, which was hard (but very rewarding in hind-sight) to conceptualize, as I was largely unfamiliar with the inner workings of real-life slot machines. All in all it's taught me a an essential habit that I will be maintaining for any future projects: that of pseudo-coding layouts. Once I did this and laid out my conditionals for the Math, the process flowed. 

### Bottom-line:
```
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
